# Saiku - Webpage
Repository of my personal webpage

# Differences:
- Website size reduced to under 300KB, instead of 4.6MB. By using various image compression techniques
- Only two pages, home & 404 -- pictures, resources, blog, about & projects have been removed, however can easily be added back
- removed themes terminal, rainy & weather --plans to add a black theme
- If you want the nitty gritty just do a git-bisect between mine and the parent project
